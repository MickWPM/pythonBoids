# Boids in Python

An example project, creating [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) in Python using [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.forward) entities.

### Setup

No specific setup is required. To run

`python3 main.py`

### Issues / TODO Fixes

1. All configuration settings are baked into the code.
2. The code is not optimised, running more than ~20 boid entities is slow.
